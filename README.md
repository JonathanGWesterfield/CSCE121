# CSCE121
All of my CSCE 121 Assignments. There are little to no comments in the code. This was my first real programming course since highschool. I got perfect scores on all almost all assignments so they are good to learn from (especially the linked list homework because that was so confusing for me). But don't copy - Aggie Honor Code reasons.
